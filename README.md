Thesis Name: Secure Digital Vault<br>

The thesis centers on the creation of a secure digital vault application with the aim of preserving critical data in an advanced, robust security environment while maintaining user friendly accessibility. It can be used by professionals and general users.

A file explorer like interface will take place in order to distinguish it from other solutions, as this is not any type of regular plain vault with secure data inside. A variety of features are included to enhance user functionality and vault usability. For example, the possibility of individual file encryption within the vault, the ability to investigate the log trail for changes related to the vault, and a file searcher within the application interface itself.

With the intention to provide more security and data integrity, a hashing algorithm takes place to keep the data genuine. An active logger will record data for any important events related to the vault, maintaining an audit log trail. Secure and advanced cryptographic methods will be utilized to implement the encryption and decryption mechanisms in the vault.

Attaching voices notes to the files is possible, it can serve as a way to describe the content of the file or simply represent it as metadata.
The vault is also able to encrypt itself back to its opening state if abrupt closure happens. This emergency lock down serves as a pivotal key for an enhanced overall reliability of the vault.

Of course, it is definitely possible to forget the access code to the vault, a careful recovery method will take place. Without it, such vault can be rendered inaccessible in the case of access code loss.
